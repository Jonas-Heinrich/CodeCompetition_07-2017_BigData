                            Big Data is on everyone&#39;s lips. Data is knowledge and knowledge is power. But what is the point behind this saying and the buzzword &quot;Big Data&quot;?<br>
                            That is what we want to deal with in this Code Competition. &quot;Big Data&quot; is about the evaluation of large amounts of data. The evaluation firstly consists of processing, so that it can be automatically analyzed by appropriate algorithms. Then it is about the recognition of patterns and connections within the data to ultimately derive knowledge and visualize it.<br>
                            The following steps are therefore important:

                            We provide you with data from a racing game. In this record you will find 160,000 races.<br>
                            Out of this (meta)data you can already make interesting statements (Who drives when preferably and against whom races? Won or lost?) and derive predictions.<br>
                            Tip: Filter the entries based on the questions you ask it.

The content of the array is between the curly braces. Every data pair represents a kind of weather and the probability of its occurrence. The kinds of weather (entries in the array) are separated by semi colons. There are 4 types of weather (sunny rainy, thundery, snowy). In front of every kind there is an „s:“ and an integer. The integer describes the length of the following string (e.g. sunny 5 characters, thundery 8 and so on). Behind the type of weather there is also an „i:“ and another integer. The number behind the i (i for integer) describes the likelihood of the weather happening in percent.<br>

                                With the introduction of new content (such as DLC, add-ons, etc.) or a sale, player numbers climb in the short term, leading to spikes in activity. As more and more players leave the game however, there is a lack of player engagement (especially in a multiplayer game) which accelerates the downward trend.</p>

                                First, they lose a lot of their games; either they quit, have connection problems, are trolling or are just really bad drivers.<br>
                                Additionally there are errors in the fuel data set. Not all the rows have actual numbers in them, some contain information like &apos;Jan 17
                                &apos;, &apos;Apr 35&apos; or &apos;Feb 61&apos;. These have nothing to do with fuel (rather date?) and therefore have to be ignored, with no extra fuel added.

                            I chose the web because it is platform independent, easy to use and very accessible. For many of my future projects I will need a website, so therefore having had experience with it previously is very beneficial.

                            I chose Python because it is fast to program in. The data is converted by Python to a permanent output, therefore the greater execution time does not really matter.<br>
                            And I had to pick JavaScript because of the way the web works.

                            The language system. Normally you would do this on the server side but I did not want to do it here for reasons that I do not want to clarify (I have done it successfully before).<br>
                            But having this implementation of the system (see documentation) was just a pain, altough the concept is not bad in general (e.g. Android language files).

                    <p>It then saves these results in two files to the JavaScript solution directory. There are two files which are split because of the time it takes to load the player data. DataCollection.js contains the data for the sections <b>The Raw Data</b>, <b>General Data</b>, <b>Track Data</b> and <b>Weather Data</b>. PlayerDataCollection.js contains all <b>Player Data</b>.</p>
                    
                    <h4>DataItem.py</h4>
                    
                    <p>This file contains the definition for the DataItem class. It is used to store all the data for every race in races.csv.</p>
                    
                    <p>It takes a line as a parameter and parses it to extract the necessary data. The data can then be accessed by calling its properties. It also has methods to simplify conditionals.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Parse.py</h4>
                    
                    <p>This file contains the code that handles the parsing of races.csv. The GetInput() method returns an array of DataItem(s).</p>
                    
                    <h4>Output.py</h4>
                    
                    <p>This file contains useful functions for generating json strings from an object, specifically a list or a dictionary.</p>
                    
                    <h4>PlayerItem.py</h4>
                    
                    <p>This file contains the definition of the PlayerItem class. It is used to store information about a player.</p>
                    
                    <p>It takes a player id as a parameter. Through public properties and a variety of methods it is possible to manipulate data about a player. This data can then be turned into a json string.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Processing.py</h4>
                    
                    <p>This file contains the core of the application. It contains functions for every data segment of the website. Each function takes the parsed data as an input, further processes it and returns a JSON string.</p>
                    
                    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    
                    <p>The JavaScript files can be found in the repository (INSERT GITHUB) under /src/output/js. </p>
                    
                    <h3>JavaScript - Behaviour</h3>
                    
                    <h4>index.js</h4>
                    
                    <p>This file contains the main behaviour of the website. Any button clicks on the website lead to a function that is called in index.js.</p>
                    
                    <h4>animation.js</h4>
                    
                    <p>Animation.js contains various functions for animating and manipulating html elements. It does not act itself, rather is it mainly called from outside to manipulate.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Language.js</h4>
                    
                    <p>Language.js contains the logic that is needed to display the correct language.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        There are 2 types of language resources. The LanguageEntries and the LanguageRepository. The former contains an array of LanguageEntry(s), which are used to automatically update the language of the website by saving its class name / id and the piece of text associated with it.<br>
                        The LanguageRepository is an object which is used by other pieces of code to get a certain string that is identified by another unique string identifier.

                    <h3>JavaScript - Solution</h3>
                    
                    <h4>main.js</h4>
                    
                    <p>main.js contains the top level logic of the solution. It is responsible for calling the processing methods and finishing the loading animations once the data is loaded.</p>
                    
                    <h4>DataCollection.js</h4>
                    
                    <p>DataCollection.js is generated by the Python code and contains all the relevant data for the Raw Data, General Data, Track Data and Weather Data section. It contains a JavaScript object that can be accessed by the other pieces of code in a structured way.</p>
                    
                    <h4>PlayerDataCollection.js</h4>
                    
                    <p>PlayerDataCollection.js is generated by the Python code as well and contains all the relevant data for the Player Data section. It expands the JavaScript object DataCollection.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h4>PlayerDataInterpreter.js</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        PlayerDataInterpreter.js is the interface that the other code uses to access the player data section in the DataCollection object.<br>
                        The PlayerData is generated as an unstructured array in order to save space. In order to make programming easier, the Interpreter provides methods that accesses certain data in the array and returns it parsed and ready to use.<br>
                        An important note is that the player id and the index in the player data array do not correlate. Some player ids do not show up in the dataset and would therefore be wasted space. Whenever you read playerIndex (or just index), it means the actual index in the array and playerID (or just id) means an actual playerID that might not even exist in the data.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Output.js</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        Output.js contains various functions that are used by other code to display the data on the screen. It can build image collections, placements, tables and charts.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Processing.js</h4>
                    
                    <p>
                        Processing.js is the core of the website. It takes the data from the DataCollection object and displays it in a meaningful way.<br>
                        Each section has its own dedicated distributor function that in turn has more functions for every solution section. The functions are executed in async and are called by main.js when the data has loaded.
